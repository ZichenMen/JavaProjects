    After running both the recursion and iteration methods multiple times with different inputs,
    Iâ€™ve observed that the iterative version consistently outperforms the recursion version.
    As the input increases, The gap between the recursive version and the iterative version is getting bigger and bigger.
    When the input came to 20000000, the recursive version takes twice as long as the iterative version.
    The reason for this is the recursive version has a significant overhead due to the function call stack.
    On the other hand, the iterative version does not suffer from the overhead of managing the call stack.
    None of these approaches can always be the most efficient approach. We need to consider multiple factors when choosing between them.
Problems:
  None.
Questions:
  None.
